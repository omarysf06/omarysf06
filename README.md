Hi everyone, my name is Omar Yousfi. I'm a 17 year-old Moroccan Senior Year High School student studying Mathematical Sciences B. Aside from my interests in maths and physics, my main interest is programming games. I'm currently learning on my own, through YouTube videos and many other sources, and so far I'm making good progress. The current project I'm working on is a recreation of the Super Mario Bros. game. I'm using this game and this project as a startup to my game development career, and I'm treating it like a learning process, just like any other project I might work on in the future.

Please feel comfortable going through what this account has to offer, and I encourage you to check out any source code I upload here, and if you find some bug, a better way to code something, or just a complete mess somewhere, please contact me about it and I'll make sure to fix it as soon as possible; I'm still learning after all, and I'll always be.
